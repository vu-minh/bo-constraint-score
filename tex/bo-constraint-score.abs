%%   In data analysis, visualization through dimensionality reduction is one of the most effective ways to understand a dataset. However, those visualization algorithms are sometimes difficult to tune for end-users.
  %% Indeed, the problem is how to make these powerful techniques more accessible to end-users who do not have advanced knowledge in machine learning. We propose a solution to free users from choosing the perplexity, an hyper-parameter of $t$-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding ($t$-SNE), while still obtaining a good quality result. Users first define their requirements for the expected visualization in term of visual constraints that can be easily collected via an interactive interface. Our method then selects the visualization that best fits their needs. Our resulting visualizations are compared with several quality metrics to assure the reliability of the proposed method. Without requiring expert knowledge about the datasets nor about complex visualization techniques, a dozen of predefined constraints reflecting the natural cognitive judgments of users are enough to find an adequate visualization.
